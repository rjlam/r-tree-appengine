%====== OVERVIEW =======================
\section{Overview}
\label{sec:intro}
Google App Engine (GAE) allows for rapid development of web applications without worrying about maintenance or scalability\footnote{\url{https://developers.google.com/appengine/}}. It follows the key-value storage paradigm for persistent as well as in-memory storage. 

We developed a route planning application, \emph{RNav}, that leverages an R-Tree structure on the server side. Using the California Roads data set~\cite{Online:cardata}, we provide route guidance functionality given two input points A and B (assuming A and B are within the described area). The project consists of six components:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The R-Tree data loader, which will convert the geo data into a key-value-compatible R-Tree index (this and part 1 may possibly be combined)
\item The actual R-Tree index, which can process the native R-Tree operations,
\item An algorithm module to compute the shortest route from point A to point B,
\item A simple query engine to process navigation requests, 
\item A query frontend for entering route requests, and
\item A result generator to present the final route to the user. 
\end{enumerate}

Currently Datastore (the GAE key-value store) does not have native support for indexing spatial data and also uses a non-relational database model. Thus, the main challenge for this project was translating the traditional R-Tree implementation in~\cite{DBLP:conf/sigmod/Guttman84} into its GAE equivalent given the constraints of using a key-value store.

The architecture of our project is presented in Section~\ref{sec:architecture} and the implementation details are discussed in Section~\ref{sec:implementation}. We conclude with a discussion about our application and a summary in Sections~\ref{sec:analysis} and \ref{sec:conclusion}

The architecture of a common Google App Engine application is depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:gappsArch}. A user makes a web request, which gets forwarded to the Python backend, which itself processes the request and interacts with the data store. The data can either be stored persistently or in memory. The latter is referred to as ``Memcache''. Usually data access follows standard key-value protocols. For our project we created an R-Tree index within GAE Datastore to efficiently serve spatial queries. This is schematically shown in Figure~\ref{fig:gappsArch2}. The actual R-Tree layout and implementation is described in Section~\ref{sec:implementation}.

Additionally, we implemented a route-finding algorithm, which takes as input the list of roads retrieved via the R-Tree lookup and generates a route from point A to point B. The resulting is presented to the querying user in a graphical result view.


%====== IMPLEMENTATION ==================
\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}
\subsection{R-Tree layout in Datastore}
Datastore is a distributed schemaless key-value object datastore that is designed for scalability. It only allows for certain data types to be stored and does not support certain operations such as joins and filtering on multiple attributes. It is possible to store basic data types like integers, short strings, text, and also generic blob data. A Datastore key is composed of a unique identifier and an optional name. When storing an object for the first time, a unique key identifier is automatically created and can be accessed via the Datastore API. 

It is not possible to directly store general objects. Because of this it is not entirely straightforward how to store an R-Tree, which is composed of three non-standard object types: rectangles, entries, and nodes. Recall from Guttman's paper\cite{DBLP:conf/sigmod/Guttman84} that there are two types of nodes in an R-tree: internal and leaf. All nodes have a list of entries describing its children. An internal node entry is of the form ($MBR$, $ptr$) and a leaf node entry is of the form ($MBR$, $oid$), where $MBR$ is the minimum bounding rectangle for the child, $ptr$ is a pointer to the child node, and $oid$ is the identifier for the object in the database. In this traditional R-tree, nodes correspond to pages.

In contrast our GAE implementation stores nodes as a key-value pair (key=$key$, value=$entries$), where $key$ is a unique automatically generated value and $entries$ is a list containing information about the node's children stored as a blob. The entries in $entries$ are blob-serialized using Python's \textit{cPickle} module and are of the form ($MBR$, $child\_key$), where $child\_key$ refers to the Datastore object containing the child node. If it is a leaf node, $child\_key$ is \textit{None} for all entries since our dataset only consists of spatial data. To extend this to more general objects we can have $child\_key$ refer to a non-node object in the datastore. In order to refer to a child node within an entry, the entry needs to know the node's key identifier in the data store. Thus, the tree must be built bottom up: we must start by allocating leaf-level nodes, then obtain their corresponding $key$ from the Datastore to update the relevant $child\_key$ in its parent. This continue upwards until we reach the root. To keep track of the root of the R-tree, we store an object containing metadata about the structure in the Datastore. This metadata object stores information such as the root key, the page size, and the minimum number of entries per node. By checking whether the metadata is present, we can infer whether there is a tree saved in the data store or not.

We also store as much of the R-tree as possible in the Memcache, a non-persistent in-memory data cache layer above the Datastore. This helps somewhat with performance since we no longer need to communicate as frequently through the network to retrieve nodes from the Datastore. Thus, before performing each query, we check if the data is in the Memcache. If not, then we fetch the nodes from the Datastore and store these in the Memcache. The Memcache API does not allow for any sophisticated cache replacement policy and only offers users the ability to set the cache expiration time, the default being never. Since we have a static dataset we keep the default expiration time; thus evictions only occur due to memory pressure.

Insertion and search are performed as described by Guttman\cite{DBLP:conf/sigmod/Guttman84} except we navigate to different nodes using keys instead of pointers. Our implementation also uses the quadratic split algorithm discussed in the paper on an overflow. Currently we do not have a working delete algorithm, but since our present data set is static it is acceptable. We thus leave the delete function as a future task.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:analysis}
We now briefly discuss and analyze our application. Currently the performance of a search query is slow. However, we note that our Memcache hit rate is extremely high --- other than compulsory misses we have no cache misses. We speculate then that our performance may be due to the overhead of storing entries as blobs; we note that in other implementations such as Geodatastore\footnote{\url{https://code.google.com/p/geodatastore/}} that spatial data is hashed based its coordinate and this hash is used as the key in the database; nodes are thus stored in lists that are natively supported by Datastore. However, we sought to create a more generalized R-tree for Datastore for this project that could handle multi-dimensional data, which other implementations do not support.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We were able to create RNav, a route planning application built using Google App Engine. It utilizes an R-tree structure built on top of a key-value datastore on the back-end to index data on roads in California. In addition to the R-tree, RNav is comprised of components such as the R-tree loader, navigation algorithm, and front-end. The application is available at \url{http://r-tree.appspot.com}
