Here is how to use the Gooleified R-Tree: 
(add "from rTree import *" )
1) Initiate: 

# those values can be tweaked, obviously
pageSize = 100
minEntries = 50

meta = DBMetaData.get_by_key_name("metadata")
# not initialized yet 
if not meta : 
	tree = RTree(pageSize, minEntries)
	tree.save()
# we already have an RTree, grab the root
else :
	tree = RTree(None, None)
	
	
	
2) Fill with entries: 

Example 1 - individual: 

recs = [Rect([0, 0], [2, 2]), Rect([5, 5], [7, 7])]
i = 0
for item in recs : 
	rec = Entry(item)
	tree.insertRecord(rec)
	
#important, we need to update metadata!
tree.save()	
	
Example 2 - from a file in the same directory as the web application: 

fileName = "someFile.dat"
# the file is assumed to be of the form "x_min\ty_min\tx_max\ty_max\n"
insertFromTree(fileName, tree)


3) Search: 

searchRec = Entry(Rect([6, 4],[10,6]))
results = tree.search(searchRec)
# results is a list of Entry objects


4) Delete: 

Don't bother at this point - Delete is buggy. We won't need it for the application but I'll fix it anyway.
